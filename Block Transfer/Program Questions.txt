*Note that there can be changes in certain programs which are not reflected here.
1)To add two memory Blocks(8 bits each) and store two byte result
2)WAP to find absolute difference of two numbers, stored in memory location 5000H and 50001H. Store the result in 5002H.
3)To count even and odd numbers
**Thumb rule--For accessing more than two memory locations use Memory pointer

4)Write a program in which a block of data is stored in memory location 2000H. The length of the block is stored in location
1FFFH. Write ALP program that searches for the first appearance of data D9H in given block. Store the address of this occurence
in H-L Pair and if the number is not found then H-L pair should contain 5000H.

5)Write a program to search for first occurence of data 87H in a given block of 20 Memory Locations. Store the address of this occurence
in D-E Pair.

6)Write a ALP to count how many number of times a particular data has got repeated in a memory block. Store the count in Memory Location
in 2100H.
